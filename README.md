# password-generator
Random password generator with Python, using the werkzeug library; the latter to be able to encrypt them by means of the sha256 algorithm. The code is not mine, I only use it to generate password encryption. In itself, it belongs to UskoKruM.

IMPORTANT

You need to install the werkzeug package before you start writing the code. To do this, you will use the 'pip' command.

pip install werkzeug

And that should be enough, if you install it in a virtual development environment. I suggest that you always install the packages globally, that is, if you are on Windows, using powershell or cmd; in Linux via terminal.
